# GMU CTHD MMS 
GMU - George Mason University, CTHD - Current Total Harmonic Distortion, MaMS - Monitor and Mitigation System
GMU ECE 493 Adv Snr Design NUCLEO F439ZI (MCU) CTHD Monitoring System Code. Uses stm32cubeide for uploading code to MCU.

## Description

Designed to be used with an external MCU to provide serial data for a CTHD MMS.
Specifically refer to https://github.com/MikeOttenVA/Adv.-Senior-Design-MCU/

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Everything needed should be included in this download
Recommened to use external program on NUCLEO F439ZI MCU, link: https://github.com/MikeOttenVA/Adv.-Senior-Design-HTML
* Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing program.
* ex. Windows 10

### Installing

Download file, everything is included.
* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Executing program

Setup serial port using Baudrate 115200 and look for ST-link if using F439ZI and provided code here, link: https://github.com/MikeOttenVA/Adv.-Senior-Design-HTML
* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets
```
code blocks for commands
```

## Help

There are a few known bugs.
